My name is Rob and I'm just beginning my journey building agentic AI systems. 

I have 10+ years experience in biological systems engineering for disease modeling and drug development. Recently I developed an automated youtube shorts engine in just a few hours using GPT5 & Gemini3 and since then, I've been hooked. I'm currently teaching myself everything about agentic AI architecture using an army of LLM personas. My newly spawned GitHub/documentation mentor informed me that I need to be documenting my progress, so here I am (it tried to write this README for me but I wouldn't let it).

I develop code modularly utilizing multiple LLMs through a structured, iterative process from a systems design perspective. I have the following projects in varying states of completion, although I have paused development to strengthen my knowledge base so I can build more solid systems.

1.    A linear automated youtube shorts engine. I haven't paid for a leonardo.ai subscription and one script batch request consumed all my tokens, so there is no youtube channel to point to, but perhaps one day I will flood the earth with glorious high quality AI slop. (Because isn't that what we all really need right now).
2.    A medicinal chemistry RAG that converts xlsx to sql with gated heuristic mapping, vector search, RDkit access, and a medicinal chemist persona for predictive modeling of efficacy, toxicity, and solubility.
3.    A differential diagnostic system that I am very passionate about. It is in conceptual design at the moment and I really need to expand my toolkit to implement my vision as it is a complex multi-agentic system with many advanced features designed for deployment at scale in a very challenging use case. I think I have something very special with this one, but it's going to take hard work for my technical acumen to catch up with my vision. This project is my main goal I am working towards.
4.    I've currently hit the wall utilizing cloud based models (RIP tokens), so I've paused development while I build a server to locally host my own LLM and databases so I have the resources I need to take these projects to the next level.
